# fornt-end-task

Used tailwind for the styling and added aditional custom classes whenever needed

## Known issues for this project to have -

## Repeating CSS properties
Should have started mobile first, since I didn't I handicapped myself when it comes to styling later. Unnecessary classes and repetition in media queries

## Vanilla js
Ran into some difficulties while making the gallery, overall I think it turned out well

## Mobile version
Sould be working ok

## Browser support
Hasn't been tested on different browsers/virtual machines.
